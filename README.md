## Overview

The idea of the app is inspired from a front-end mentor challenge. Using REST Countries API it is an app to show the world countries and filter them according to their region with displaying some details about each one of them, and it also has a theme changer.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the countries
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode
